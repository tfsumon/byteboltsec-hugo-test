The 2013 Target data breach was one of the largest and most infamous data breaches in history. 

Over 40 million payment cards and the personal information of up to 70 million customers were exposed. 

The incident had far-reaching consequences, not only for the affected customers but also for Target itself. In this article, we will discuss [how the breach happened](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/data-breach-causes/), its financial implications, and lessons learned from this massive security failure.
## How Did the Target Data Breach Happen?
The Target data breach was a result of a sophisticated cyberattack that exploited multiple vulnerabilities. The attackers initially gained access to Target's network through a [third-party HVAC vendor](https://breachsense.com/blog/third-party-data-breach/), who had been granted remote access to the company's systems for maintenance purposes. 

Once inside, the attackers moved laterally through the network, eventually reaching Target's point-of-sale (POS) systems.

The hackers installed custom-made malware on the POS systems, which allowed them to capture customer payment card data as it was being processed. 

The stolen data was then transferred to servers controlled by the attackers, who then sold the information [on the dark web](https://www.breachsense.com/dark-web-monitoring/). The breach went undetected for several weeks, during which time the attackers continued to collect sensitive customer data.
