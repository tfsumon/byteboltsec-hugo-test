Insider Threats Cause 60% of Data Breaches [Prevention Guide]
Insider threats pose a significant risk to organizations, accounting for 60% of data breaches. 

These breaches can be caused by malicious insiders seeking personal gain, as well as unintentional incidents due to negligence or lack of awareness. 

In this article, we discuss the prevalence of insider threat data breaches and provide practical tips to help your organization prevent these incidents and protect your valuable data assets.
## The Majority of Data Breaches are Caused by Internal Threats
Insider threat data breaches occur when employees, contractors, or third-party partners with legitimate access to an organization's data and systems misuse their access to steal, leak, or compromise sensitive information. These breaches can have severe consequences, including financial losses, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust.

And, unfortunately, the number of such incidents has [risen by 47 percent since 2018](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/resources/threat-reports/cost-of-insider-threats), while their cost has risen by 31 percent in the same time period.

Malicious insiders may act with the intent to harm the organization, [driven by factors such as](https://identitymanagementinstitute.org/insider-threats-to-system-and-data-security/) personal grievances, financial incentives, or espionage. 

In other cases, breaches result from unintentional actions, such as falling victim to phishing attacks, failing to follow security protocols, or inadvertently sharing sensitive data with unauthorized individuals.

Regardless of intent, the consequences of insider threat data breaches can be significant, and organizations must prioritize strategies to mitigate these risks.
