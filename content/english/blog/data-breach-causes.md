Despite significant progress in enhancing cybersecurity, data breaches continue to be a major concern in today's technology-driven world. 

According to a recent report by IT Governance, data breaches increased by 12.7% in the first quarter of 2023 alone, affecting millions of individuals and businesses worldwide. 

To combat the risk of data breaches, it is essential to identify the primary causes behind them.  

In this article, we examine some of the leading factors contributing to data breaches and provide recommendations on how to safeguard your business against these potential threats.

Let’s start. 
## 5 Most Common Data Breach Causes
The reasons behind a data breach can vary widely based on several factors, including the methods used by cybercriminals, the type of organization targeted, and more.

The following section will provide insights into five of the most common data breach causes.
### #1. Malware
Malware, short for "malicious software," is one of the most common causes of a [data breach](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/what-is-a-data-breach/). 

Malware is any software designed to infiltrate and damage computer systems, steal data, or disrupt a company’s routine operations such as processing data, communication, file sharing, and other business-related tasks. 

Malware can take many forms, including viruses, Trojan horses, worms, and ransomware. Once it infects a system, malware can steal sensitive data, corrupt files, and even take control of the entire system.

To protect against malware, it's important to have up-to-date antivirus software, avoid suspicious emails and downloads, and ensure that all operating systems are working with the latest security updates.
### #2. Weak or Stolen Credentials
Credentials refer to login information that allows access to a system, application, or network. 

Cybercriminals achieve this by using tactics such as credential stuffing or credential spraying to effortlessly gain unauthorized access, especially when weak and commonly used passwords are in place. 

That’s why it’s important to ensure that your users are utilizing strong and complex passwords that are not related to personal information. 
### #3. Social Engineering
Social engineering is a tactic used by cybercriminals to manipulate people into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that can compromise data security. 

Typically, social engineering attacks occur in several stages. 

First, the attacker conducts research on the intended target to gather the necessary information required to launch the attack. 

The attacker then builds trust with the victim and provides stimuli to trigger actions that compromise security, such as granting access to critical resources or disclosing confidential information. 

An effective approach to detecting and preventing social engineering is through technical controls that prevent [human error](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/data-breach-human-error/). 
### #4. Unpatched Security Vulnerabilities
When security teams fail to patch widely-used software vulnerabilities, they create an opportunity for cybercriminals to infiltrate networks. 

These unpatched [vulnerabilities are often exploited by attackers](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/vulnerabilities-cause-data-loss/) as an entry point to breach networks and can become an initial attack vector for ransomware.

While security and software vendors continually scan, identify, and provide patches for new vulnerabilities, the software will always pose a certain degree of risk. 

This is precisely why cybersecurity teams must continuously address known vulnerabilities and unpatched software. 

In addition, implementing software to automate and manage the patching process enables quicker and more effective patch management. 

Automated patch management can simplify the task of maintaining current operating systems and applications by first automating scans that evaluate devices within the network to identify missing patches for each system, software, or app. 

Then, automated distribution delivers the necessary patches to all applicable devices.
### #5. Third-party Breaches
[Third-party data breaches](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/third-party-data-breach/) happen when sensitive data is stolen from a vendor or when their systems are used to access and steal confidential information stored on your systems. 

The term "third-party vendors" refers to external parties with whom a company shares its data, which may include contractors, marketing agencies, or cloud service providers.

According to the [Cost of a Data Breach Report by IBM](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/3R8N1DZJ), third-party involvement was one of the top five factors that amplified the cost of a data breach, adding an average of $370,000 to the total cost, which reached $4.29 million. 

That's why third-party risk management and vendor risk management are critical aspects of any organization's enterprise risk management plan.

## Data Breach Damage
Data breaches can cause significant damage to both businesses and individuals, including financial losses, reputational damage, emotional distress, and more. 

Here’s a quick look at five of the most significant ramifications of data breaches.

* **Data Breach Damage for Organizations**: A data breach can have a significant impact on an organization, both financially and reputationally. The direct [costs associated with a data breach](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/cost-of-a-data-breach/) can include expenses related to incident response, forensic investigations, legal fees, regulatory fines, and lawsuits.
* **Data Breach Damage for Individuals**: The exposure of personal and sensitive information, such as social security numbers, credit card details, and login credentials, due to data breaches can result in significant harm to individuals. This information can be sold on the dark web, leading to identity theft, financial fraud, and other types of malicious activities.
* **[Data Breach Damage for Business](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/small-business-data-breach-consequences/)**: A data breach can have a devastating impact on businesses, particularly small and medium-sized ones (SMBs). Data breaches result in significant financial losses, with the average cost of a breach being around [$4.24 million](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach?_ga=2.145424945.424390126.1682950905-55973012.1682950905), of which 38% accounts for lost business. The reputation of a company can also suffer a significant blow, as consumers tend to prefer doing business with [companies that they perceive as safe and trustworthy](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/data-breach-trust/).

## How to Prevent a Data Breach
Implementing and adhering to best practices that [bolster data breach prevention](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/prevent-data-breach/) is crucial for organizations and their employees. 

Some of the best practices to consider are:

* **Train for Security Awareness**: By providing security awareness training, organizations can raise awareness about the importance of cybersecurity and teach employees how to identify and [respond to potential threats](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/data-breach-response-plan/).
* **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Zero-Trust Architecture is a security framework that assumes that all users, devices, and applications are untrusted and must be verified before being granted access to a network or system. 
* **Data Encryption**: Data encryption refers to the process of converting plain or unencrypted data into a code or cipher that can only be read or understood by authorized parties who have access to the encryption key. 
* **Dark Web Monitoring**: [Dark web monitoring](https://www.breachsense.com/dark-web-monitoring/) involves actively searching and keeping track of your organization's data on the dark web. Dark web monitoring tools are designed to function like search engines, but specifically for the dark web. They assist in locating any leaked or stolen information, including [compromised passwords](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/password-security-data-breach/), breached credentials, sensitive data, and intellectual property that may be circulating on the dark web.
