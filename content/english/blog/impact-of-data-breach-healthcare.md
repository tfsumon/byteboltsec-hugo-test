As we venture further into the digital age, the healthcare industry finds itself grappling with an unsettling issue in 2023 - data breaches. 

With digital systems becoming more deeply embedded in the industry, healthcare providers and patients face growing concerns over the security of sensitive information. 

But how exactly do these breaches impact healthcare, and what are the ramifications for patients and providers alike?

In this article, we deep dive into how data breaches impact healthcare in 2023 by explaining their causes and the potential consequences that come with them. 
## What Is a Data Breach in Healthcare?
A data breach occurs when Protected Health Information (PHI) is accessed or disclosed by unauthorized parties. PHI refers to any information that can be used to identify an individual, including their health status and healthcare services provided to them. 

[Data breaches](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/what-is-a-data-breach/) in the healthcare industry are a major concern as they can lead to significant harm to patients and their privacy, as well as severe financial consequences for the medical practice.

Specifically, such breaches can lead to identity theft, insurance fraud, and even medical malpractice.

Healthcare data is becoming an increasingly attractive target for cybercriminals. This is because such data can [be sold for up to ten times](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cybersecurity-hospitals-idUSKCN0HJ21I20140924) the amount that credit card information can fetch on the dark web.

Here are 14 [tried-and-true ways to prevent data breaches in healthcare](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/prevent-data-breaches-healthcare/) you wish you’d known sooner. 
## 4 Impacts of Data Breaches in Healthcare
In the ever-evolving world of healthcare, data breaches are a constant threat that can result in a range of negative consequences for patients and healthcare organizations alike. 

Here are the four most significant impacts a data breach of classified health information can have:
### #1.Financial Impact
The most significant risk posed by a data breach in the healthcare industry is the financial damage that can affect not only the healthcare organization but also its patients. 

According to recent statistics, a data breach can cost a healthcare organization [$211 per record](https://www.experian.com/assets/data-breach/white-papers/consequences-medical-id-theft-healthcare.pdf) that has been compromised, as well as additional potential fines.

Implementing measures to address these breaches requires funds that could otherwise be used for patient care and research.
### #2. Patient Privacy
Data breaches in healthcare can result in the exposure of patients' personally identifiable information (PII), including names, social security numbers, medical history, and more. 

This can result in a breach of patient privacy and can potentially lead to identity theft, financial fraud, or other types of harm to the patient.
### #3. Legal Consequences
When a healthcare organization experiences a data breach, it can have serious legal consequences.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ([HIPAA](https://www.itechart.com/blog/hipaa-compliant-app-development/)) sets strict rules for the protection of patients' personal health information, and organizations that fail to comply can face significant fines and penalties. 

In addition, affected individuals may file lawsuits, resulting in substantial financial damages and negative publicity for the organization.
### #4. Medical Identity Theft
Medical identity theft occurs when someone steals a person's personal health information and uses it for fraudulent purposes, such as obtaining medical care or prescription drugs. 

Victims of medical identity theft may face difficulty accessing healthcare services and may experience harm as a result of incorrect medical treatment based on false information in their records.

## How Do Data Breaches Happen?
Whether it's a malicious malware attack or a [third-party data breach](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/third-party-data-breach/), the risk of sensitive data being compromised is a constant concern for healthcare providers. 

Below, we'll explore some of the primary [causes leading to a data breach](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/data-breach-causes/):

* **Hacking and IT incidents**: Hacking and IT incidents are one of the most common causes of data breaches, accounting for [80% of all healthcare data breaches in 2022](https://fortifiedhealthsecurity.com/mediacoverage/bonus-features-february-5-2023-78-of-data-breaches-result-from-hacks-or-it-incidents-nova-scotia-taps-oracle-cerner-for-ehr-modernization-and-more/). Hackers use various techniques such as phishing, malware, exploiting leaked credentials, and brute-force attacks to gain unauthorized access to systems and steal sensitive information.
* **Insider threats**: Employees or contractors with access to sensitive data can intentionally or unintentionally expose this information by sharing it with unauthorized individuals, misusing it, or falling victim to a phishing scam.
* **Improper disposal of PHI**: Improper disposal of PHI is also a common cause of data breaches in healthcare. This occurs when organizations fail to properly dispose of data-containing devices, such as throwing away paper records or not wiping old hard drives before selling or donating them. This [leaves sensitive information vulnerable](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/vulnerabilities-cause-data-loss/) to unauthorized access and puts patients at risk of harm. 
* **Vulnerabilities in Your Servers**: Vulnerabilities in your organization's servers can also cause data breaches. Failure to implement adequate security measures such as encryption, password protection, and access controls can leave sensitive information vulnerable to cyberattacks.
* **Physical Theft**: Mobile devices such as laptops, smartphones, or portable hard drives containing personal data can be lost or stolen, potentially leading to a data breach. Because of that, organizations must implement security protocols to encrypt and password-protect mobile devices containing sensitive information.

## Costs of Data Breaches in Healthcare
As we previously mentioned, data breaches in the healthcare industry have become more frequent, and their financial impact has become increasingly severe. 

According to [a study by IBM](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach), the average cost of a healthcare data breach in the United States exceeded $10 million in 2021. This represents a 41.6% increase from 2020.

The report also found that it took an average of 287 days for healthcare organizations to detect and contain a data breach. 

The longer it takes to address a data breach the costlier it gets, considering that data breaches can become more severe with time.

Aside from the [direct costs of investigating the breach](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/cost-of-a-data-breach/), notifying affected individuals, and providing credit monitoring services, a considerable amount of data breach costs in healthcare come from regulatory fines.

For example, if a medical practice experiences a data breach and is found to be in violation of HIPAA regulations, it could face significant fines from the regulatory body. These fines can add up quickly, depending on the severity and scope of the breach, and can have a substantial impact on the finances of the practice. 

Furthermore, medical identity theft is a significant risk associated with data breaches in healthcare. According to [a study by the Medical Identity Fraud Alliance](https://www.medidfraud.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2014_Medical_ID_Theft_Study1.pdf), the average cost of a medical identity theft case is over $13,500, and it may take months or even years to resolve.
## 3 Large Medical Record Breaches
In recent years, there have been several high-profile medical record breaches that have exposed sensitive patient data and caused widespread concern. 

In this section, we will explore three large medical record breaches and the impact they have had on patients and the healthcare industry:

* **Community Health Systems Data Breach**: In 2014, Community Health Systems (CHS), a major hospital network in the United States, experienced a massive data breach that affected millions of patients. The breach was caused by a group of Chinese hackers who [deployed malware](https://www.bcmpedia.org/wiki/Sophisticated_Malware) to steal sensitive information from CHS's computer systems. As a result, the personal and medical information of approximately 4.5 million patients was compromised, including names, addresses, and social security numbers.
* **Advocate Health Care Data Breach**: In 2013, a series of data breaches affected Advocate Health Care after four unencrypted laptops containing the medical information of 4.03 million patients were stolen. Advocate Health Care's lack of data encryption was a clear violation of the data protection requirements outlined in HIPAA. To send a strong message to other healthcare organizations about the consequences of such negligence, Advocate Health Care was fined $5.55 million by the Health and Human Services Department. 
* **UCLA Health Data Breach**: In July 2015, UCLA Health discovered that hackers had gained access to their computer systems and had stolen personal and medical information belonging to 4.5 million patients. The investigation into the breach revealed that the attackers used a “[watering hole attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watering_hole_attack)". UCLA Health was fined $7.5 million for failing to report the breach in a timely manner, which was a clear violation of the breach notification protocol outlined in HIPPA.

Here are some more [examples of famous data breaches](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/data-breach-examples/) to show you the devastating consequences a data breach can have on your business.
