According to the “Cost of Data Breach Report” by IBM and the Ponemon Institute, the financial impact of a data breach continues to rise, reaching a record high of $4.35 million in 2022. 

In fact, experts predict that this trend will continue in 2023, with average costs potentially reaching up to $5 million.

As the threat of cyberattacks continues to loom over businesses of all sizes, it's more important than ever to take proactive steps to mitigate the risks of data breaches. 

In this article, we'll take a closer look at the costs of data breaches today, exploring the key factors that contribute to the fact that they’re constantly rising and the implications they can have on your business. 
## 13 Key Findings of the 2022 IBM Cost of Data Breach Report
[The Cost of a Data Breach Report](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/3R8N1DZJ) by IBM and the Ponemon Institute offers IT, risk management, and security leaders a lens into factors that can increase or help mitigate the rising cost of data breaches.

The report takes into account numerous cost factors, including legal, regulatory, and technical activities. 

The information is based on 550 breaches across 17 countries and 17 industries, with data gathered from over 3,600 interviews.

In this section, we will summarize 13 crucial findings from the report that can help you align your data security and breach prevention strategies with the critical risk factors in 2023.
### #1. The Global Average Cost of a Data Breach Increased to $4.24 Million
In 2022, the cost of a data breach reached an unprecedented level, averaging $4.35 million. This is a 2.6 percent increase from the previous year, where the cost of a breach was $4.24 million. 

Compared to the 2020 report, the average cost has escalated by 12.7 percent, rising from $3.86 million.
### #2. The Cost of a Data Breach Was Approximately USD 1 Million on Average in Cases Where Remote Work Was Involved
The shift to remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the way businesses operate, including their [vulnerability to data breaches](https://breachsense.com/blog/vulnerabilities-cause-data-loss/). 

According to the report, organizations with a higher percentage of remote workers have incurred a significantly higher cost of data breaches compared to those with a lower percentage of remote workers.

For organizations where 81 percent to 100 percent of employees worked remotely, the average cost of a data breach was a staggering $5.10 million, compared to $3.99 million for organizations with less than 20 percent of remote workers. 

The difference between these two categories was a substantial $1.11 million. 
### #3. The Healthcare Industry Incurred the Highest Cost of a Data Breach
The healthcare industry has long been a prime target for cyberattacks, and the latest findings from the report only confirm this unfortunate reality. 

The healthcare industry once again holds the dubious distinction of having the highest average cost of a data breach, marking the eleventh consecutive year at the top of the list.

The cost has increased by almost 30 percent compared to the previous year. In 2021, healthcare organizations faced an average total cost of $9.23 million for a data breach, up from $7.13 million in 2020.

### #4. Companies With a Fully Deployed Security AI and Automation Saw a 70% Reduction in Data Breach Costs
As businesses face increasing cyber threats, many are turning to security [AI and automation controls](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/9NGZA7GK) to detect and contain data breaches more quickly and effectively. 
 
According to the report, businesses that have fully deployed security AI and automation have seen significant benefits in terms of both cost savings and breach detection speed.

Specifically, these organizations spent an average of $3.05 million on data breach damages, which is a remarkable $1.3 million less than the global average across all security environments. 

Furthermore, they detected breaches much faster than those without security AI and automation deployed, with a median time to identify of just 249 days, compared to 323 days for organizations without these technologies.
### #5. The Most Common Initial Attack Method Was Compromised Credentials
The data shows that in 2022, the most common way that cyber attackers gained access to organizations’ data was through compromised credentials.

Compromised credentials accounted for almost 20 percent of all data breaches, underlining the importance of [strong password hygiene](https://breachsense.com/blog/password-security-data-breach/) and employee security training.

The report also highlights other concerning trends, such as the rising cost of [data breaches caused by third-party vendors](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/third-party-data-breach/), which increased to $4.55 million in 2022. The cost associated with system errors also jumped significantly by $480,000.

On the other hand, some attack vectors saw a decrease in associated breach damage costs, including business email compromise, [malicious insiders](https://breachsense.com/blog/insider-threat-data-breach/), and [breaches that are due to human error](https://breachsense.com/blog/data-breach-human-error/), such as accidental data loss and misconfigurations. 
### #6. 83% Of the Organizations Experienced More Than One Data Breach
According to the report, 83 percent of the organizations included in the study have fallen victim to multiple data breaches, with only 17 percent stating that 2022 marked their first breach. 

Moreover, [businesses that have been affected by data breaches](https://breachsense.com/blog/small-business-data-breach-consequences/) have been forced to pass on the higher costs to customers, with 60 percent of organizations reporting that they have raised the price of their goods and services to cover losses from the breach.
### #7. The Average Time to Identify and Contain a Data Breach Was 277 Days
The financial impact of a data breach is directly proportional to the time it takes to detect and contain it. 

The report shows the average time to identify and control a breach was 277 days, which is a slight improvement of ten days compared to the previous year. However, despite the decrease in detection times, the average cost of data breaches continued to rise.

Ransomware breaches were found to be the most challenging to detect, with an average detection time of 49 days. Supply chain breaches also took longer to identify, with a 26-day longer detection period than [other types of breaches](https://breachsense.com/blog/data-breach-types/).

The impact of the breach detection time emphasizes the importance of having a well-thought-out [data breach response plan](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/data-breach-response-plan/) for identifying and addressing security risks in a timely manner.
### #8. Industries Without Zero Trust Strategies Deployed Had Significantly Higher Data Breach Costs Than Average
The implementation of [zero-trust architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model) seems to have a positive impact on reducing data breach costs for organizations.

Zero-trust architecture is a framework that requires all users, regardless of whether they are in or outside the organization's network, to be authenticated and authorized before being granted access to applications and data. 

Businesses that adopted a zero-trust model for security spent an average of $4.15 million on data breaches. In contrast, those without this model spent an additional $1.76 million, bringing their average cost to $5.10 million. 
### #9. XDR Technology Reduced the Data Breach Lifecycle to 29 Days
Nearly half of the organizations surveyed (around 44 percent), had implemented [Extended Detection and Response (XDR)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-xdr.html) technologies. 

The adoption of XDR has provided significant advantages to these organizations in terms of response times. On average, companies that implemented XDR technologies were able to shorten the life cycle of a data breach by a month compared to those without XDR.

Particularly, organizations took 275 days to identify and contain a breach with XDR deployed, while for the rest of the organizations it took 304 days on average, representing a 10 percent difference in response times.
### #10. Supply Chain Attacks Took 26 Days Longer to Identify
[Supply chain attacks](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3191947/supply-chain-attacks-show-why-you-should-be-wary-of-third-party-providers.html) continue to be a significant threat to businesses, as highlighted in the 2022 data breach report.

Compromised third-party vendors in the supply chain caused nearly one-fifth of all breaches. The complexity of these attacks also presents a challenge in detecting them promptly, with an average detection time of 26 days compared to the global average.

Additionally, supply chain breaches result in higher costs, with an average total cost of $4.46 million compared to the global average of $4.35 million.
### #11. The Average Cost of a Ransomware Data Breach Was $4.54 Million
The report shows that the attacks including ransomware accounted for 8 percent of all breaches analyzed, up from 7.8 percent in the previous year.

On top of that, the average cost of a ransomware breach was $4.54 million, which is higher than the average cost of a regular data breach, which was $4.35 million. 
### #12. 45% of the Data Breaches Were Cloud-Based
Based on the statistics, half of the [data breaches](https://www.breachsense.com/) analyzed in the report occurred in the cloud, with hybrid cloud environments being the most affected.

However, organizations with a hybrid cloud model experienced lower costs, averaging $3.80 million, compared to those with breaches in private clouds ($4.24 million) and public clouds ($5.02 million).

This represents a significant 27.6 percent difference in cost between hybrid and public cloud breaches.

Moreover, organizations that adopted a hybrid cloud model had faster breach lifecycles than those that solely relied on public or private cloud models.
### #13. The Implementation of An Incident Response Plan Resulted in a Significant Reduction in the Data Breach Costs
Approximately 75 percent of organizations reported having an Incident Response (IR) plan, with 63 percent of them conducting regular tests.

Businesses that had an incident response team in place and regularly tested their plan saw an average cost saving of $2.66 million compared to those that didn’t.

That's a significant 58 percent difference, with breach costs totaling $3.26 million versus $5.92 million.
## How Long Do Data Breaches Impact Businesses and Organizations?
The financial repercussions of [a data breach](https://breachsense.com/blog/what-is-a-data-breach/) extend beyond its immediate aftermath and can persist for multiple years.

[Highly-regulated industries such as healthcare](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/impact-of-data-breach-healthcare/) and financial services were found to experience the most severe long-term effects of a data breach, with costs rising in the second and third years, compared to less regulated industries.

The study showed that 24 percent of the data breach costs in highly regulated industries were incurred more than two years [after the breach](https://breachsense.com/blog/after-a-breach/), whereas, in low regulatory environments, the corresponding figure was only 8 percent. 
## How Long is the Average Data Breach Lifecycle?
Detecting and containing a data breach in a timely manner is crucial in minimizing the damage it can cause. 

Organizations can assess the effectiveness of their incident response and containment procedures by looking at the duration from the first detection to containment, also known as the data breach lifecycle.

The data breach lifecycle in 2022 shows an average of 207 days to identify the breach and 70 days to contain it,  compared to 212 days and 75 days in 2021. In other words, it would take until October 4th of the same year to detect and contain a breach that happened on January 1st, based on the 277-day average in 2022.

Interestingly, this 277-day average is consistent with the average over the past seven years, with the lowest total being 257 days in 2017 and the highest total being 287 days in 2021.

To mitigate the negative impact on both finances and reputation, organizations must aim to minimize the duration of the data breach lifecycle as much as possible.
## What Was the Biggest Data Breach Contributor in 2022?
In the realm of cybersecurity, stolen or compromised credentials were identified as the primary [cause of data breaches](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/data-breach-causes/) in 2022. 

This attack vector accounted for 19 percent of all breaches analyzed, with an average cost of $4.5 million. It was also the top cause of breaches in the previous year's study, with 20 percent of breaches attributed to it.

Breaches involving stolen or compromised credentials also had the longest lifecycle, taking 243 days to identify and another 84 days to contain the breach.

Phishing was the second most common cause of a data breach, accounting for 16 percent of all breaches analyzed. These types of attacks were the costliest, with an average cost of $4.91 million in breach costs.
