The threat of data breaches has never been more real, with the past few years seeing a staggering increase in high-profile cases that have left businesses reeling from the financial and reputational fallout.

As we navigate 2023, it's essential to stay ahead of the game and understand the root causes of these breaches to prevent them from happening to your organization.

In this article, we explore **five real-life examples of data breaches** and dig deep to uncover the common causes behind them. 

Let’s get started!
## 5 Famous Examples of Data Breaches
Data breaches can lead to sensitive information getting stolen and then sold on the dark web or to [third parties](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/third-party-data-breach/). 

There have been several high-profile data breaches in recent years that have led to the exposure of millions of user records to testify to how harmful data breaches can be.

Let's take a closer look at some examples:
### #1. Equifax
The Equifax data breach, which happened in 2017, is widely considered to be one of the largest data breaches in history. 

The credit reporting agency disclosed that the personal data of more than 147 million individuals were exposed. This included sensitive information such as names, birth dates, Social Security Numbers, addresses, and, in some cases, driver's license numbers and credit card information.

The breach resulted from a vulnerability in an Equifax web server that should have been patched. However, internal process failures left the vulnerability unaddressed, providing attackers with an open door to exploit.

The attackers were able to take advantage of the web portal to access other servers because the systems were not properly segmented. They also discovered usernames and passwords stored in plain text, which enabled access to even more systems.

The attackers operated unnoticed for months, extracting data from the network in encrypted form. Equifax's failure to renew a TLS/SSL certificate on one of its internal security tools was the critical reason for the attackers' success.

The Equifax data breach had significant repercussions, including Congressional hearings and increased scrutiny of the credit reporting industry's data security practices. 

As a result, Equifax paid a settlement of up to $700 million to affected individuals and regulatory agencies.
### #2. Yahoo
The Yahoo data breach was a series of cyberattacks on Yahoo's systems that took place between 2013 and 2014 but were not discovered until September 2016. 

The company disclosed that the attacks had resulted in the theft of personal data from all three billion user accounts on Yahoo's platform, making it one of the largest data breaches ever.

The Yahoo data breach was initiated through a spear-phishing email that was sent in early 2014 to a Yahoo employee.

Once the hacker gained access to the network, they focused on two primary targets: the user database and the Account Management Tool used to modify the database.

To maintain access, the hacker installed a backdoor on a Yahoo server that granted them “free entry”. In December of that year, the hacker stole a backup copy of Yahoo's user database, which was then transferred to their computer.

The database contained valuable information such as names, phone numbers, password challenge questions and answers, and most critically, password recovery emails, and hashed passwords. 

Hashed passwords are passwords that have been processed through a hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or argon2id, which transforms plain text into an incomprehensible combination of letters and numbers.

Yahoo has stated that the hackers did not gain access to users' financial information, such as credit card numbers or bank account information, as that data was stored separately and encrypted.

The breach had far-reaching consequences for Yahoo and its users, including damage to the company's reputation and numerous lawsuits from affected parties. The company paid a $117.5 million settlement.
### #3. First American Financial Corporation
In 2019, First American Financial Corp. suffered a major data leak due to poor data security measures and a flawed website design. 

While this incident was not a result of hacking, it highlights how easily private information can be accessed by unauthorized parties.

The breach occurred due to a website design flaw called [IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)](https://spanning.com/blog/insecure-direct-object-reference-web-based-application-security-part-6/), which allowed access to confidential information without verification or authentication procedures. This flaw meant that anyone with a link to the documents could view them without any restrictions. 

Additionally, since First American Financial Corp. logged their records in sequential order, users could modify the number in the URL to access other customer records.

As a result of the IDOR vulnerability, approximately 885 million files were exposed, including bank account numbers, bank statements, mortgage payment documents, wire transfer receipts containing social security numbers, and driver's licenses.

Fortunately, there were no reported cases of data being compromised or exploited. However, the breach resulted in First American being fined approximately $500,000 by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  for administrative errors and disregarding red flags in 2018.

The First American Financial Corp. data leak serves as a stark reminder of the importance of implementing strong cybersecurity measures to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.
### #4. Facebook
Despite being one of the biggest tech companies in the world, Facebook has faced several data leaks since going live in 2012. 

In April 2021, Facebook experienced one of its largest data breaches, when a massive amount of data related to more than 530 million Facebook users was posted publicly in an online hacking forum. 

It is believed that the leaked data was obtained in 2019 when a group of hackers took advantage of a vulnerability in Facebook's contact importer.

At that time, Facebook users could easily find people by entering their phone numbers into the contact importer. The hackers scraped user profile data using this tool, in violation of Facebook's terms of service. Most of the data obtained was associated with users' phone numbers, while only 2.5 million email addresses were obtained.

Facebook addressed the vulnerability by September 2019 but opted not to notify the 530 million affected users about the data breach.

The Data Protection Commission of Ireland imposed a [$276 million fine](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/28/23481786/meta-fine-facebook-data-leak-ireland-dpc-gdpr) on Facebook in November 2022 concerning the incident, for breaching the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
### #5. Microsoft 
In early March 2021, the cybersecurity world was shocked by the news of a large-scale attack on Microsoft Exchange email servers. 

The attack was carried out through a series of [zero-day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)) exploits, which are software vulnerabilities unknown to the software developer and which have not been patched. In this case, the zero-day exploits targeted four vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server software, which allowed the attackers to gain access to email accounts and install malware.

The first vulnerability made it possible for the attackers to bypass authentication and gain access to the server, while the second vulnerability allowed them to write files to the server. 

The third vulnerability allowed the attackers to execute code on the server, and the fourth allowed them to steal data from it.

Once the attackers gained access to a server, they were able to install [web shells](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/02/11/web-shell-attacks-continue-to-rise/), which are scripts that allow remote access. With web shells in place, the attackers could remotely execute commands and steal data, including emails, contacts, and other sensitive information.

Despite Microsoft's efforts to release patches addressing the vulnerabilities exploited in the Microsoft Exchange email cyber attack, the effectiveness of these patches relied on individual server owners applying the updates promptly. Failure to update their systems would leave the vulnerabilities open to exploitation by attackers.

The decentralized nature of the affected systems made it impossible for Microsoft to push immediate updates to all servers, as it could with cloud-based systems. 
## 3 Common Data Breach Causes 
In this section, we will explore three common causes of data breaches and leaks to gain a better understanding of their potential impact: 

### #1. Weak and Compromised User Credentials
Weak and stolen credentials are among the most common [causes of data breaches](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/data-breach-causes/). While passwords are often used to protect sensitive data, they can also be the weakest link in cybersecurity. 

To reduce the risk of weak and stolen credentials, companies should not only [implement strong password policies](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/password-security-data-breach/) but also ensure that they have a robust cybersecurity monitoring program in place to detect and respond to potential breaches.

Two-factor authentication is another effective security measure that provides an additional layer of protection by requiring users to provide a second form of identification, through software or hardware token.
### #2. Social Engineering
Social engineering attacks, such as phishing emails, phone calls, or in-person interactions, can have [serious consequences for businesses](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/small-business-data-breach-consequences/) as cybercriminals can use the data obtained to breach IT systems and launch further attacks.

To prevent and mitigate the risks associated with social engineering attacks and data breaches, companies should increase spam filtering via email gateways and consider the implementation of antivirus and endpoint security tools.

Employee education and training are also critical in helping to identify and avoid social engineering attacks.
### #3. Malware
Malware is a type of software designed to damage, disrupt or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, and data. It comes in various forms, including viruses, worms, Trojan horses, spyware, ransomware, adware, and infostealers. 

Once it infects a system, it can cause significant damage, such as stealing sensitive information, disrupting system operations, encrypting files, and rendering systems unusable.
## 4 Types of Data Breach
To effectively safeguard your organization's data, it's important to understand the various [types of data breaches](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/data-breach-types/) that can occur. Below we will cover four of the most common types of data breaches:
### #1. Ransomware
Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts files stored on electronic devices, rendering them inaccessible to the owner. The latest versions of ransomware are increasingly sophisticated, with some even corrupting or erasing data.

Moreover, cybercriminals can use ransomware to steal your files and use them to extort you, offering the option to pay up or risk having sensitive information exposed to the public.
### #2. SQL Injection
SQL Injection is a code injection technique that attackers use to exploit vulnerabilities in a web application's database layer. This technique allows an attacker to insert malicious SQL code into a query, which can then be used to manipulate the application's database, leading to various potential issues.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is used by many web applications to interact with their databases. When a web application takes user input and includes it in an SQL query without properly sanitizing it, an attacker can include their own SQL commands which the database will execute.

To prevent SQL Injection attacks, developers should use prepared statements, parameterized queries, or ORM frameworks, all of which can ensure that user-supplied input is always treated as literal data, not executable code.
### #3. Phishing
Phishing is a malicious tactic in which attackers send fraudulent emails or messages to deceive recipients into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials, financial data, or personal information.

These emails or messages are designed to appear as if they are from trustworthy sources, such as reputable companies or organizations, and often contain links or attachments that, once clicked or downloaded, install malware on the victim's device.
### #4. Cross-Site Scripting Attack (XSS)
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of web-based attack in which an attacker injects malicious code into a website, often through a vulnerable web application. 

This code is then executed when a user visits the affected webpage, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information or take control of the victim's session.

XSS attacks can be prevented by implementing proper input sanitization and validation techniques, as well as security measures like [CSP (Content Security Policy)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) and input filtering.
## 6 Ways to Prevent a Data Breach
[Data breaches can be a costly](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/cost-of-a-data-breach/) and damaging experience for your company. 

In this section, we'll share six tried-and-true ways to [prevent data breaches](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/prevent-data-breach/) and keep your sensitive information secure, starting with:
### #1. Multi-Factor Authentication
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an effective way to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. 

This requires users to provide multiple forms of authentication to access systems and data, making it much more difficult for cybercriminals to gain access.
### #2. Regularly Update Software and Systems
Software and systems that are not up-to-date can contain vulnerabilities that cybercriminals can exploit to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Updates often include security patches that address known vulnerabilities and security flaws in software and systems. Failure to apply such patches leaves organizations at risk of a cyber attack, which can result in significant financial losses and reputational damage.
### #3. Implement Encryption
Encryption is a crucial security measure that can prevent data breaches by rendering sensitive information unreadable and unusable to unauthorized users. 

It works by converting plain text into cipher text using advanced mathematical algorithms that are almost impossible to decipher without the appropriate decryption key.
### #4. Dark Web Monitoring
Businesses can use [dark web monitoring](https://www.breachsense.com/dark-web-monitoring/) services to detect if any of their confidential data, such as leaked passwords, intellectual property, or other sensitive information, is being shared on the dark web. 

These services use a combination of HumanInt, and OSINT, as well as automated or AI-powered scanning tools to search through billions of pages on the dark web constantly. 

Whenever the service detects any information that matches the company's data, it sends an immediate alert to the IT team, notifying them of the exposure.
### #5. Implement Clear Policies and Procedures
Clear policies and procedures should be established to help employees understand their responsibilities in safeguarding data. 

This includes developing clear policies on password security, data access, and data storage.
### #6. Conduct Employee Training
Regular employee training on data security best practices is a must when it comes to data breaches. 

Employees should be educated on how to identify and respond to potential security threats such as phishing attacks and other forms of social engineering.

## 4 Ways to Recover From a Data Breach
A [data breach](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/what-is-a-data-breach/) can lead to severe consequences, including financial losses, reputation damage, and identity theft. If a company falls victim to a data breach, it's crucial to take immediate action to contain the breach.

Here are four important steps that organizations can take [in the aftermath of a data breach](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/after-a-breach/) to recover:
### #1. Contain the Breach
The first and most critical step in dealing with a cyber attack is to contain the potential damage by identifying and isolating affected systems. 

Disconnecting the internet, removing compromised devices, updating systems, and changing passwords can help prevent further damage. 
### #2. Evaluate the Damage
Once the initial containment phase has been completed, organizations should investigate the extent of the damage. 

This involves identifying the type of data that was compromised and its potential impact on individuals and the company itself.
### #3. Address Possible Weaknesses
After conducting a damage evaluation, it is necessary to address the possible weaknesses that may have contributed to the breach. 

This can involve conducting a risk assessment to identify any [vulnerabilities that were exploited](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/vulnerabilities-cause-data-loss/), evaluating existing security measures, and implementing additional security protocols to prevent future breaches.
### #4. Notify All Stakeholders
Following a data breach, it's crucial to notify the appropriate parties to minimize the potential harm to affected individuals and comply with relevant regulations. 

The company should provide details about the extent of the breach, the type of information that was compromised, and the measures being taken to prevent it from happening again.
## FAQs on Data Breaches
Do you still have some questions about data breaches? Check out our answers to the most frequently asked questions below: 
### #1. How common are data breaches? 
Data breaches are becoming increasingly common in today's digital landscape. [According to reports](https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/87787-hackers-attack-every-39-seconds), the number of cyber attacks per day is estimated to be around 2,200, with an attack happening approximately every 39 seconds on average.
### #2. Is Data Breach a Cyber Crime?
Cybercrime refers to any illegal activity carried out using digital devices or the internet. When someone gains unauthorized access to a computer system or network and steals, exposes, or manipulates sensitive data, it is considered a cybercrime. 
### #3. What Is the Difference Between a Data Breach and a Data Leak? 
A data leak happens when confidential data is unintentionally made public, while a data breach happens as a result of a cyberattack.

A data breach typically involves an external event that leads to the compromise of data. This event is often initiated by a cybercriminal through actions like a phishing attack.

A data leak, on the other hand, occurs due to internal factors. The confidential data may be exposed due to software vulnerabilities that internal security teams might overlook, or [insider threats](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/insider-threat-data-breach/) could deliberately create an attack vector for hackers to access the sensitive data.

The consequence of data leaks and data breaches is similar, as they both result in sensitive data being compromised. The main factor that distinguishes the two is the cause that leads to this outcome.
