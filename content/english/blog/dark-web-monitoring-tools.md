## What is dark web monitoring

Dark web monitoring is a service that involves scanning, searching, and analyzing the dark web to identify and track the illegal trading or sharing of sensitive information, such as credentials, financial information, intellectual property, or other confidential materials.

The dark web is a part of the internet that is not indexed by traditional search engines. This includes not only tor sites, but Telegram channels and dark web forums requiring authentication.

The purpose of dark web monitoring is to help organizations detect if their sensitive information has been compromised and is being sold or shared on the dark web.

By identifying the issue early, they can mitigate the risk before criminals exploit the data. Typical actions include updating passwords, implementing security measures based on the leaked data, or alerting authorities.

Dark web monitoring services use various tools to scan private websites, criminal forums, and marketplaces on the dark web, looking for specific data such as email addresses, social security numbers, credit card numbers, session tokens, internal company documents, or other sensitive information.

## What causes data breaches

In order to understand how dark web monitoring tools work, it's important to understand what causes data breaches in the first place.

Data breaches occur for a number of reasons. These range from technological vulnerabilities to [human error](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/data-breach-human-error/).

Here are the top 5 primary data breach causes:

1. Weak or Stolen Credentials
2. Human error
3. Malware
4. Insider threats
5. Outdated or misconfigured software

## Who needs dark web monitoring

Dark web monitoring is essential for any company with access to sensitive data.

Common use cases include:

1. **Businesses and Organizations:** Companies of all sizes use dark web monitoring tools to protect their customer data and intellectual property. This is especially important in regulated industries that handle sensitive information, like finance, [healthcare](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/prevent-data-breaches-healthcare/), and legal services.
2. **Financial Institutions**: Banks, credit unions, and other financial organizations need dark web monitoring to detect potential threats to their customers' financial information, such as credit card numbers, account details, and social security numbers.
3. **Government Agencies**: Government bodies use these tools to protect national security information, prevent [identity theft](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/dark-web-identity-theft/) of its citizens, and detect potential threats. They also use it to comply with regulations and to prevent leaks that could compromise public safety or national interests.
4. **Healthcare Organizations**: Hospitals, clinics and health insurance providers use dark web monitoring tools to protect patient information and to comply with healthcare privacy laws (like [HIPAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act) in the U.S.)
5. **Educational Institutions**: Schools and universities use dark web monitoring to protect student records, financial information, research data, and to comply with privacy standards (like [FERPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Educational_Rights_and_Privacy_Act) in the United States).
6. **Legal Firms**: Law practices handle a vast amount of sensitive and confidential client information, including personal data, financial records, and proprietary business information. Dark web monitoring can help detect if any of this information has been compromised and is being circulated or sold on the dark web.
7. **IT and Offensive Cybersecurity Teams**: Security teams use dark web monitoring tools as a part of their broader defensive infrastructure to gather intelligence about emerging threats and cybercrime trends. Pen testers and red teams use the data to escalate privileges during engagements.
8. **Retailers**: Retailers often possess a large amount of customer data, including personal information and payment details. Dark web monitoring can help prevent fraud, maintain compliance and prevent breaches leading to reputational damage.
9. **Private Individuals**: One of the primary benefits for private individuals is the early detection of personal information, such as Social Security numbers, credit card details, or bank account information, being sold or shared on the dark web. This can help folks take quick action to prevent identity theft and financial fraud.
10. **Non-profit Organizations (NPOs)**: NPOs often handle sensitive data, including donor information, financial records, and personal details of beneficiaries. Dark web monitoring can help detect if any of this information has been compromised and is circulating on the dark web.

## Key features to look for in a dark web monitoring solution

Dark web monitoring is an essential tool in an organization’s cyber defenses.

When looking for a dark web monitoring solution, there are several key features to consider:

- **Comprehensive Data Set:** The solution should use a combination of OSINT and HumInt to index a wide range of data sources. These commonly include monitoring the dark web, hacker forums, [darknet markets](https://www.breachsense.com/darknet-markets/), paste sites, [Telegram channels](https://www.breachsense.com/telegram-channels/), various [ransomware gangs](https://www.breachsense.com/ransomware-gangs/) and other and other hidden services where stolen data is often traded.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** The ability to receive real-time or near-real-time alerts when your organization's data is detected on the dark web is crucial for timely response and mitigation.
- **API Support:** The solution should have easy API integration to allow complete automation and end-to-end remediation.
- **Integration with Existing Systems:** Dark web monitoring tools should integrate with the rest of your existing security stack, like SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems and your SOC (Security Operations Center).
- **Incident Response Tools:** The tool should enable incident response investigators to understand who a threat actor is, other usernames and passwords used by the attacker, as well the ability to pivot on various pieces of information to build a comprehensive picture of an attack.
- **Ease of Use and Customization:** The software should be user-friendly and intuitive. The goal should be to integrate the data and workflow into an organization’s current security stack.
