Data breaches have become an increasingly prevalent issue in recent years, causing significant harm to individuals and businesses alike.

So, what *exactly* is a data breach, and how can you protect your organization from one?

In this article, we define what data breaches are, explain their consequences, and provide practical tips to safeguard your sensitive information in 2023.

Let’s start! 
## What Is a Data Breach?
A data breach occurs when an unauthorized individual accesses, copies, steals or discloses sensitive or confidential data. 

Data breaches involve the intentional exposure of sensitive information, which is what makes them different from data leaks, where the exposure is accidental.

Data breaches are most common in industries that are dealing with large amounts of personal data, such as [finance and healthcare](https://www.cshub.com/attacks/articles/top-8-industries-reporting-data-breaches-in-the-first-half-of-2019). 
## 4 Types of Data Breaches
With the persistent threat of data breaches affecting organizations of all types and sizes, it is important to understand the different types of [data breaches that could impact your business](https://breachsense.io/blog/small-business-data-breach-consequences/). 

Here are four of the most common [data breach types](https://www.breachsense.io/blog/data-breach-types/): 
### #1. Double Extortion Ransomware
Double extortion ransomware is a technique used by threat actors to increase pressure on victims during a ransomware attack. 

Instead of solely encrypting the victim's data and demanding a ransom for its decryption, the attackers also exfiltrate sensitive data and demand a second ransom to prevent its public disclosure or sale. This approach exploits the victim's fear of data exposure, reputational damage, and potential legal consequences. 

As a result, having backups may not be sufficient to protect against such attacks, since the stolen data can still be used as leverage by the attackers, regardless of whether the encrypted data can be restored. 
### #2. Phishing
Phishing is a social engineering attack, where cybercriminals attempt to obtain sensitive information from individuals by disguising themselves as a trustworthy entity, such as a bank, government agency, or reputable company.

Phishing attacks usually take the form of fraudulent emails, text messages, or websites that request users to provide personal or financial information.

Because this type of [data breach comes from human error](https://breachsense.io/blog/data-breach-human-error/) rather than a technological flaw, combatting it is even more difficult.
### #3. SQL Injection
SQL Injection, also known as SQLi, is a technique used to attack computer systems that involves inserting malicious SQL code into a backend database to obtain unauthorized access to information.

If a SQL injection attack is successful, unauthorized parties can gain access to the database and depending on the database type and permissions set, even execute OS commands. 
### #4. Recording Keystrokes
Recording keystrokes, also known as [keylogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging), is a technique used by cybercriminals to capture and record every keystroke made on a computer or mobile device.

Keyloggers can be implemented as either hardware or software and can be installed on a target device without the user's knowledge or consent. 

Once installed, the keylogger runs in the background, silently registering all the user’s keystrokes and sending the data to the attacker's command and control server.
## 5 Data Breach Causes
Understanding the main causes that can lead to a data breach is the first step in [preventing a data breach](https://www.breachsense.io/blog/prevent-data-breach/) from happening to your organization. 

Here are some of the most common data breach causes to look out for:
### #1. Malware
Malware is a type of software that is designed to cause harm or damage to a computer system, network, or device. 

Malware can be introduced to a system through various methods such as phishing emails, software vulnerabilities, or downloads from untrusted websites.

Once installed, malware can carry out a variety of malicious activities such as stealing sensitive information, damaging files, or controlling the device remotely.
### #2. Weak or Stolen Credentials
Weak or stolen credentials refer to the use of easily guessable or compromised login credentials, which can be exploited by cybercriminals.

Weak credentials can be a result of poor password hygiene, such as using simple or easily guessable passwords, reusing passwords across multiple accounts, or failing to update passwords regularly.

Stolen credentials, on the other hand, can be obtained through various methods such as phishing attacks, malicious software, social engineering tactics, or by exploiting software vulnerabilities.
### #3. Social Engineering
Social engineering refers to manipulating people into divulging confidential information or taking actions that can compromise the security of a computer system, network, or device.

It is a form of psychological manipulation that exploits human behavior and emotions to gain access to sensitive data or systems. 

Social engineering attacks can take many forms, including phishing emails, phone calls, or in-person interactions. 
### #4. Unpatched Security Vulnerabilities
Unpatched vulnerabilities refer to security flaws in software, hardware, or operating systems that the vendor has identified but has not yet fixed with a patch or a software update.

Attackers can exploit unpatched vulnerabilities or zero-day vulnerabilities by using various attack methods such as deploying malware, conducting [brute-force attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack), or employing [network sniffing](https://www.eccouncil.org/cybersecurity-exchange/ethical-hacking/what-are-sniffing-attacks/) to gain access to vulnerable systems.

The impact of unpatched vulnerabilities can be significant, as it can create a ripple effect on other systems and networks that are connected to the affected system, leading to broader security concerns.
### #5. Third-party Breaches
A [third-party breach](https://www.breachsense.io/blog/third-party-data-breach/) refers to a data breach that occurs due to a security vulnerability of a third-party service provider or vendor that an organization uses to store or process data. 

This type of breach is becoming increasingly common as organizations continue to rely on third-party vendors such as cloud service providers, marketing agencies, or contractors, for various services and functions.

Third-party breaches can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as unsecured access points, weak or stolen credentials, unpatched security vulnerabilities, or [malicious insider activity](https://breachsense.io/blog/insider-threat-data-breach/). 
## 5 Consequences of Data Breaches
In the event of a data breach, the consequence on your business can be severe.

Some of the most impactful data breach consequences include:
### #1. Financial Losses
Data breaches can cause serious financial harm to your organization in a variety of ways, including [direct costs associated with responding to the breach](https://breachsense.io/blog/cost-of-a-data-breach) and indirect costs associated with reputational damage, loss of customers, or legal fines.

The “[2022 Cost of a Data Breach Report](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach)” by IBM and the Ponemon Institute found that the typical cost of a data breach has surged to an all-time high of $4.35 million. Nevertheless, many experts anticipate that average costs could exceed $5 million in 2023.
### #2. Reputational Damage
If the company fails to prevent a data breach, especially one that involves sensitive customer information, its reputation can suffer a major blow.

The reputational damage caused by a data breach can have long-term impacts on your company's bottom line and can be challenging to repair.

Studies indicate that as many as 33% of customers in the retail, finance, and [healthcare industries](https://www.breachsense.io/blog/impact-of-data-breach-healthcare/) may cease doing business with companies that have experienced a breach. 

Furthermore, 85% of customers are likely to share their negative experiences with others and about 33.5% will resort to social media to express their displeasure.
### #3. Legal Repercussions
Data breaches can also result in severe legal repercussions for companies that fail to adequately protect their customers' personal information. 

When sensitive data is lost or stolen, companies can face costly lawsuits and regulatory fines, and in some cases, even criminal charges.

The company may face lawsuits from customers affected by a breach seeking damages for any harm they have suffered as a result of it.

In addition to lawsuits, companies that experience a data breach may also face fines and penalties. Many countries have data protection laws that require companies to take specific steps to protect customer data, such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 
### #4. Loss of Sensitive Data
Personal data refers to any information that can be used to identify a person, such as a name, password, IP address, credentials, and even biometric or genetic data. 

Losing this information could have a serious impact on someone's life, such as identity theft, financial fraud, and emotional distress.

Biometric data is especially valuable to cybercriminals and can lead to more severe consequences than merely stolen credit card information or email addresses. 

The primary reason for this heightened risk is that, unlike passwords or account numbers, biometric data, such as fingerprints, facial features, or iris patterns, are intrinsic to an individual and cannot be changed. 

That’s why it's crucial to have a [data breach response plan](https://www.breachsense.io/blog/data-breach-response-plan/) in place to protect data privacy and reduce threats to your organization. 
### #5. Disruptions to Business Operations
A data breach can cause a significant amount of chaos and confusion within your organization, which can lead to delays in daily business operations. 

If the breach involves sensitive information, there may be a need to shut down entire systems and applications, leading to a loss of productivity and revenue.

The time and resources required to address the breach, identify the root cause, and implement remediation measures can also lead to significant disruptions. 
## 4 Data Breach Examples
If a data breach takes place, private and sensitive information could be stolen and exchanged [on the dark web](https://www.breachsense.io/dark-web-monitoring/) or sold to third parties.

Below we will delve into some [examples of the biggest breaches](https://www.breachsense.io/blog/data-breach-examples/) that led to the exposure of millions of users:
### #1. First American Financial Corp.
The First American Financial Corp. data breach occurred in May 2019 when a [vulnerability in the company's website exposed sensitive documents](https://breachsense.io/blog/vulnerabilities-cause-data-loss/) related to real estate transactions, dating back to 2003.

The breach compromised the personal and financial data of approximately 885 million individuals and was considered one of the largest data breaches in history. 

The company faced legal action and financial penalties as a result of the breach.
### #2. Marriott
The Marriott data breach occurred in 2018 and involved the personal information of approximately 500 million customers.

The attackers used a type of malware, called a RAT (Remote Access Trojan), to secretly control and monitor a target’s computer. They also used [Mimikatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimikatz) to find usernames and passwords stored in the system memory. 

The incident resulted in several investigations, lawsuits, and regulatory fines. Marriott has since implemented additional security measures to prevent similar breaches in the future.
### #3. Equifax
The Equifax data breach was a massive cyberattack that occurred in 2017, where hackers gained unauthorized access to the personal and financial information of over 147 million individuals. 

The breach was caused by a vulnerability in [Apache Struts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Struts_1) (a web application framework), which Equifax failed to patch despite being alerted to the issue months earlier. 

The stolen data included names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, and addresses, as well as credit card and driver's license information for some individuals. 

The breach had far-reaching consequences, including multiple investigations and lawsuits, and led to significant changes in the way companies handle and secure personal information.
### #4. Verifications.io
In 2019, the marketing email service provider Verifications.io suffered a data breach resulting in the exposure of 763 million email addresses and personal information such as names, phone numbers, and IP addresses. 

The unprotected database was discovered by security researchers who found that anyone with an internet connection could access the data.

It was later revealed that the company had left the database unsecured on a publicly accessible server without any password protection or authentication.
## How to Prevent Data Breaches
As data breaches can cause serious reputational and financial damage to your business, it is essential to invest resources and efforts towards preventing them.

In the following section, we will examine proven tips that both businesses and employees should take into account in order to safeguard sensitive data.
### 5 Tips for Businesses
#### #1. Employee Training
Many data breaches occur due to human error or negligence, such as falling for phishing scams or using weak passwords. 

By providing regular training on data security and privacy, organizations can educate their employees on best practices and keep them up-to-date with the latest threats and countermeasures.

This can help prevent data breaches and minimize the impact of a potential breach. 

Training is particularly important for small businesses, which may lack dedicated IT staff and resources to prioritize cybersecurity.
#### #2. Up-to-Date Software
Software updates not only offer new features and enhancements but also often include security patches and fixes for known vulnerabilities.

Failing to update software can leave systems vulnerable to attacks that could potentially compromise customer data and lead to significant financial losses. 

Therefore, keeping software up-to-date is an essential step in maintaining strong cybersecurity practices and preventing data breaches.
#### #3. Implement access controls
One way to exemplify how strict authorization processes can be effective in reducing data breaches resulting from unauthorized users is through the implementation of different access levels for employees. 

For instance, a company may establish three employee levels with varying degrees of access to data and resources, and stricter authorization processes for lower employee levels. 

Access controls can be implemented through passwords, two-factor authentication, and other security measures.
#### #4. Recovery Plan
Establish a robust disaster recovery plan that outlines clear procedures for mitigating the effects of a data breach. 

This plan should include designated contacts, communication strategies, and specific mitigation measures. 

Ensure that all employees are familiar with the plan, so they can take appropriate actions immediately [after discovering a breach](https://breachsense.io/blog/after-a-breach/).
#### #5. Ongoing Data Breach Monitoring
Ongoing data breach monitoring is a proactive approach to cybersecurity that involves continuously tracking and scanning various data sources, both public and private, to identify any indications of compromised information. 
This process can include monitoring the dark web, hacker forums, paste sites, Telegram channels, and various other platforms where stolen data might be sold or shared. 
### 6 Tips for Employees

1. **Be cautious with emails.** Be cautious when opening emails or attachments from unknown sources. Verify the sender and the content before opening any links or attachments.
2. **[Use strong passwords](https://breachsense.io/blog/password-security-data-breach/).** Create strong passwords and never share them with anyone. Use a password manager to create unique passwords for each account.
3. **Be mindful of personal information.** Do not disclose personal information to anyone, including over the phone or email, unless you have verified the identity of the person and the legitimacy of the request.
4. **Be cautious on public Wi-Fi.** Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks to access sensitive information or log into work-related accounts.
