While you may not expect to fall victim to a data breach, studies show that at least 42 million records were exposed due to data breaches between March 2021 and February 2022. 

In fact, 2021 saw some of the costliest data breaches through phishing attacks in the last 17 years.

As businesses become increasingly reliant on digital systems and technologies to enable remote work, the risk of cybersecurity incidents, including data breaches, continues to rise.

So what should a company do after a data breach? 

The actions your company takes in the aftermath of a data breach can define whether you successfully mitigate the data breach or suffer its negative consequences.  

To help your business, we’ve put together a guide covering what causes data breaches and the key steps a company should take after a data breach.

Let’s dive in.
## 6 Things Your Company Should Do After a Data Breach
If your business falls victim to a data breach, it’s crucial to take certain actions to safeguard your interests, customers, and your reputation. 

Here is what you can do:
### #1. Contain the Breach
When dealing with a cyber attack, the first and most critical step is to contain the potential damage. This requires identifying the affected systems and servers that were compromised and quickly isolating them to prevent the spread of the malicious code.

Here are some immediate actions you should take:

* Disconnect your internet connection and remove all compromised servers, computers, and mobile devices from the network to prevent further spreading of the malware.
* Disable remote access and check your firewalls to ensure all systems are updated and patched.
* Update all other systems and change passwords to strong, unique ones for each account. Additionally, check the machines for infostealer malware and enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to bolster security and reduce the risk of future data breaches.

Spend time investigating the incident, gathering evidence, and reporting to regulatory bodies and stakeholders. This approach will help minimize further damage and build trust with your customers.
### #2. Evaluate the Damage
After isolating the affected systems, your next step should be to conduct a thorough investigation into the data breach. 

This investigation should focus on identifying how the breach occurred, and which data was compromised. Digital forensic experts or trained IT personnel can assist in this process.

Key aspects of the forensic investigation would include:

* **Taking Pictures of the Affected Servers and Systems**: This preserves a snapshot of the system at the time of the breach, which can be crucial for identifying how the breach occurred and who was responsible.
* **Investigating the Memory of Affected Systems**: Look for traces of the attacker's activity, such as evidence of malware or other malicious software, and analyze system and application logs to trace the attacker's actions.
* **Preserving Evidence Related to the Breach**: Carefully preserve system logs, network traffic data, emails, and other documents for further analysis and potential legal action. Maintain a chain of custody for all evidence to ensure its integrity.

In addition, this is the right time to assess the effectiveness of any [network segmentation](https://www.techslang.com/definition/what-is-network-segmentation/) measures that were in place to prevent hackers from moving from one server to another.

Identifying the source of the breach can be facilitated by conducting comprehensive log analysis from various security systems, such as affected servers, [WAFs (Web Application Firewalls)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_firewall), Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), and firewalls. These systems automatically log security events and provide valuable information on the location and timing of the breach, contributing to a more thorough understanding of the incident.

Although it is possible to gather relevant information without such IT systems, it may be more time-consuming and resource-intensive.

During the damage assessment, it is crucial to also investigate whether the breach resulted from leaked passwords, human error, or software misconfiguration. Understanding the root cause and location of the breach, as well as whether it was internal or external, is critical to implementing measures to prevent recurrence.

To determine the exact location of the breach, the company should compile a list of all users with access to the compromised system(s).
### #3. Address Possible Weaknesses
After a data breach, it is important to address the weaknesses that led to the breach. This may involve collaborating with your IT security team or engaging external security experts for a forensic investigation.

Based on the findings, you can then implement both immediate and long-term solutions to address any vulnerabilities and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

Immediate and long-term solutions should consider the following key factors, which often contribute to ransomware attacks:

* **Leaked passwords**: A significant number of ransomware attacks stem from leaked or stolen passwords. It is crucial for companies to have ongoing visibility into their employees' leaked data and enforce strong password management practices.
* **Phishing**: Phishing attacks are a common method used by cybercriminals to infiltrate networks and deploy ransomware. To avoid this, implement advanced email filtering and monitoring solutions to detect and block phishing attempts. Provide regular employee training on how to identify and avoid phishing emails.
* **Unpatched servers**: Maintain a regular patch management schedule for all servers and software applications. Employ continuous vulnerability scanning and assessment tools to identify and remediate weaknesses.
### #4. Notify All Stakeholders
Following a data breach, it's crucial to notify the appropriate parties to minimize the potential harm to affected individuals and comply with relevant regulations. 

Here are the key stakeholders you should inform when a data breach occurs:
#### Regulatory Bodies and Law Enforcement
Depending on the sector and type of breach, companies may be required to notify law enforcement authorities, such as the FBI or the OCR, based on federal or state laws. 

Data protection laws also require companies to report breaches within a specified time frame, as well as provide a detailed and thorough explanation of how and why they occurred and what the company is doing to resolve the issues.
#### Customers, Clients, and Stakeholders
To effectively notify the affected parties, companies should determine the best method of communication and clearly explain how cybercriminals accessed and used stolen information. 

Providing contact details for additional questions is important, as is being transparent about what information was exposed and what the company is doing to mitigate the damage. 

Prompt data breach notifications can help affected parties manage their risk and take necessary measures.
#### Cyber Insurance Companies
Cyber liability insurance is highly recommended, especially for companies operating with critical data. 

Although it doesn't [prevent data breaches](https://www.breachsense.io/blog/prevent-data-breach/), it can cover financial damages resulting from a breach, such as the costs of investigating and responding to the incident, potential legal fees, and damages resulting from lawsuits.
#### Staff and Third-Party Entities 
Companies should also inform internal staff about the data breach and the steps being taken to resolve the issue. Third-party agencies affected by the breach, such as vendors, contractors, or suppliers, should also be notified.  

If the data breach involves social security numbers, it's important to notify major credit bureaus, such as Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. 

Credit counseling services should also be provided to help affected individuals protect their credit and prevent further damage from identity theft.
### #5. Evaluate the Effectiveness of Cybersecurity Measures
After implementing data protection measures, a [company should conduct a security test](https://www.breachsense.io/) to determine whether its system can withstand another cyber attack. 

Following this, you should upgrade your company policies and procedures to ensure that they are better equipped to deal with future cyber threats and data breaches.

To prevent any potential risks, you should conduct a penetration test (also referred to as ethical hacking) to identify vulnerabilities that pose a threat to your network. 

This will make it impossible for another hacker to replicate the previous initial attack vector.

It’s important to perform security testing on an annual basis, as well as before pushing any significant changes to production. 
### #6. Implement Fresh Measures for Data Security Governance
After a [data breach](https://www.breachsense.io/blog/what-is-a-data-breach/), the company needs to conduct an internal review of its policies and identify any security gaps that led to the incident. 

To prevent the chance of another breach, you should also update your security measures. It is also necessary to review incident [response plans](https://www.breachsense.io/blog/data-breach-response-plan/) to ensure they cover all potential attack scenarios and have clear response procedures. 

If the plans are unclear, they should be revised.

Business continuity and disaster recovery plans are also essential to maintain operations in the event of a breach. Regular reviews of all plans - incident response, business continuity, and disaster recovery - are necessary.

Having an incident response team in place can help reduce the [cost of damages](https://www.breachsense.io/blog/cost-of-a-data-breach/) resulting from a breach. A designated individual or team, such as a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or Chief Information Officer (CIO), can lead the response effort and assemble IT security response teams dedicated to protecting customer data.
## 5 Common Data Breach Causes
According to the [IBM 2021 Cost of a Data Breach Report](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach), compromised or stolen login credentials were not only the primary cause of data breaches but also the hardest to identify.

Wondering what else leads to a data breach? Let's delve into five of the most common [data breach causes](https://www.breachsense.io/blog/data-breach-causes/):
### #1. Weak and Compromised User Credentials
Weak and stolen credentials are among the most common causes of data breaches. Passwords are often the first line of defense for protecting sensitive data, but they are also the weakest link in cybersecurity. 

Cybercriminals use various techniques, such as phishing attacks, malware, and brute force attacks or credential stuffing, to obtain login credentials.

To mitigate the risk of weak and stolen credentials, companies should implement strong password policies, 2FA(Two-Factor Authentication), and data breach monitoring.
### #2. Social Engineering
Social engineering is one of the three most common initial attack vectors leading to a data leak, along with unpatched systems and stolen credentials. 

Social engineering is the use of manipulative tactics to trick people into giving up sensitive information or access to secure systems.

This can be done through various methods such as phishing emails, phone calls, or even in-person interactions. 
 
To prevent and mitigate the risks associated with social engineering attacks and data breaches, an effective approach would be the implementation of technical controls that prevent human error, segmenting the network, and improving threat intelligence capabilities.
### #3. Malware
Malware, short for malicious software, is one of the most widespread causes of data breaches. 

It refers to any software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, and data.

Malware comes in different forms, including viruses, worms, Trojan horses, spyware, infostealer malware, ransomware, and adware. It can be introduced into a system in various ways, such as email attachments, infected websites, compromised software, or infected removable media.

Once malware infects a system, it can cause significant damage, including stealing sensitive information, disrupting system operations, encrypting files, and rendering systems unusable.
### #4. Third-Party Breaches
A [third-party data breach](https://www.breachsense.io/blog/third-party-data-breach/) refers to a situation where your data is compromised, not due to a direct attack on your systems, but rather due to a data breach toward a third-party vendor or partner who has access to or stores your data.

Third-party vendors refer to any external parties with whom a company shares its data, such as cloud service providers, marketing agencies, or contractors.

As third-party vendors often have access to an organization's most confidential information, including financial records, customer data, and intellectual property, these breaches can be extremely damaging.
### #5. Physical Theft of Sensitive Devices
Stealing company devices can lead to security breaches and identity theft, resulting in data breaches.

Attackers can use these stolen devices to gain access to sensitive information, such as login credentials. For instance, an attacker may contact the IT administrator from a stolen laptop and convince them to disclose login information, allowing the attacker to remotely log into the company's network.
