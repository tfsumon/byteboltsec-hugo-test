## What is dark web monitoring?

Dark web monitoring is a service that enables MSPs to search for and monitor the dark web for their client's information, such as leaked employee or customer credentials, internal company documents, or sensitive financial records. The dark web is a part of the internet that is not indexed by traditional search engines. This includes not only Tor sites but also Telegram channels, criminal marketplaces, and hacker forums requiring authentication.

The goal of dark web monitoring is to help organizations detect when their sensitive information has been compromised and is being sold or shared on the dark web.

Identifying issues early enables MSPs to mitigate the risk for their clients before criminals exploit the leaked data. Remediation typically includes updating passwords, implementing additional security measures, or alerting authorities.

## What causes data breaches?

Before we talk about how dark web monitoring tools work, let's talk about what causes data breaches in the first place.

Data breaches happen for a number of reasons. These range from technological vulnerabilities to [human error](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/data-breach-human-error/).

Here are the top 5 primary data breach causes:

1. Weak or Stolen Credentials
2. Human error
3. Malware
4. Insider threats
5. Outdated or misconfigured software

## Who needs dark web monitoring?

As an MSP, dark web monitoring is a valuable service to offer to a variety of clients, particularly those with access to sensitive data. These include:

1. **Businesses and Organizations:** From small businesses to large enterprises, any organization that handles sensitive data such as customer information, financial records, or intellectual property can benefit from dark web monitoring. This is especially important in regulated industries that handle sensitive information, like finance, healthcare, and legal services.
2. **Healthcare Organizations**: Given the sensitive nature of medical records and the strict regulations surrounding patient privacy (such as HIPAA in the United States), healthcare organizations are prime targets for cybercriminals. Dark web monitoring can help detect if patient data is being traded or sold online.
3. **Financial Institutions**: Banks, credit unions, and other financial services providers deal with highly sensitive financial data that can be lucrative for cybercriminals. Monitoring the dark web can help these organizations detect potential threats to their customers' financial security.
4. **Educational Institutions**: Schools, colleges, and universities often hold a wealth of personal information about students and staff, making them targets for identity theft and other cybercrimes. Dark web monitoring can help protect this information.
5. **Government Agencies**: Government entities handle a vast amount of confidential data, from personal information of citizens to classified national security data. Monitoring the dark web can help identify and mitigate threats to this sensitive information.
6. **Legal and Professional Services Firms**: Law firms, accounting firms, and other professional services organizations often handle confidential client information that could be damaging if exposed. Dark web monitoring can help safeguard this information.
7. **Retailers and E-commerce Businesses:** Companies that conduct business online are at risk of having customer data, including credit card information, compromised. Dark web monitoring can help detect if this data is being sold or traded illegally.
8. **Non-profit Organizations (NPOs)**: NPOs often handle sensitive information, including donor details, financial records, and personal information of beneficiaries. If this data is compromised and ends up on the dark web, it can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and reputational damage.

## Key features MSPs should look for in a dark web monitoring solution

Dark web monitoring is an essential tool for MSPs to keep their clients safe.

When looking for a dark web monitoring solution, there are several features to look for.

- **Comprehensive Data Set:** The solution should be able to monitor a wide range of sources on the dark web, including forums, chat rooms, marketplaces, and other platforms where sensitive information is shared or sold.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** The ability to receive real-time alerts or notifications when a client's data is detected on the dark web is crucial for quick response and mitigation of potential threats.
- **Advanced Search Capabilities:** The solution should offer advanced search capabilities to pivot or drill down into specific keywords or other identifiers related to the client's sensitive information.
- **API Support:** The solution should support automating queries via an API to automate both detection and mitigation.
- ******Integration with Existing Systems**:**** The ability to integrate the dark web monitoring solution with other security tools and platforms used by the MSP, such as incident response systems, SIEMs (Security Information and Event Management), or ticketing systems.
- **Incident Response Tools:** The tool should enable incident response investigators to understand who a threat actor is, other usernames and passwords used by the attacker, as well the ability to pivot on various pieces of information to build a comprehensive picture of an attack.
- **Ease of Use and Customization:** The software should be user-friendly and intuitive. MSPs should integrate the data and workflow into their current security stack.
