A data breach may well be your business’s worst nightmare. 

It can ruin your brand reputation, eat away at revenue, and ultimately lose you clients. 

Unfortunately, data breaches have grown increasingly common. 

In the third quarter of 2022, a whopping 15 million data records got exposed worldwide. And this figure is a 37 percent increase from the preceding quarter!

So what can you do? 

One of the first steps in protecting your organization from data breaches is *knowing* about the different types of data breaches. 

In this article, we outline seven data breach types to watch out for, explain why they happen, and list the most common ransomware out there.   
## 7 Data Breach Types
These are the seven types of data breaches that each organization should avoid: 
### #1. Double Extortion Ransomware
Double extortion ransomware is a particularly pernicious type of cyberattack [that has been on the rise](https://ciphertrace.com/ciphertrace-report-double-extortion-ransomware-jumped-by-nearly-500-last-year/). 

In this type of data breach, cybercriminals not only encrypt a company's data and demand a ransom for its release but also threaten to leak the stolen data publicly if the ransom is not paid. This two-pronged approach significantly increases the pressure on the victim to pay the ransom, hence the term "double extortion". 

To protect your business against such attacks, you should make sure your system software is updated, backups taken regularly, and the network is properly segmented.
### #2. Malware
Malware is a broad term that encompasses various types of malicious software, including viruses, trojans, and spyware. 

This malicious software can infiltrate a network or computer system, causing harm by deleting, altering, or stealing data. 

Malware often enters a system through deceptive links, fraudulent emails, or infected software downloads. As such, protection against malware requires the use of comprehensive and up-to-date antivirus software, combined with employee education on recognizing and avoiding potential threats.
### #3. Phishing
Cybercriminals employ phishing to trick individuals into providing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details. 

This is usually achieved by impersonating a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication, such as an email. Clicking on a link or opening an attachment in a phishing email can lead to data theft or malware infection. 

Effective strategies to combat phishing include training employees to recognize phishing attempts, implementing email filtering software, and encouraging the use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
### #4. Recording Keystrokes 
Keylogging, or keystroke recording, is a data breach technique where cybercriminals use a software or hardware device to record the keys struck on a keyboard without the user's knowledge. 

This information can include passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive data. These devices may be physically attached to a computer, or more commonly, a malicious software program may be installed on a user's device through an email attachment or malicious website. 

[To prevent this data breach type](https://breachsense.io/blog/prevent-data-breach/), it's essential to employ reputable security software, maintain regular system updates, and encourage safe browsing habits among employees.
### #5. Stolen Information 
One of the most straightforward types of data breaches involves directly stealing information. 

This can occur through physical means, such as the theft of a laptop or smartphone, or digital methods, such as hacking into a network to access confidential files. The stolen information can then be sold, used for fraudulent activities, or leveraged for competitive advantage.

An [example of such a data breach](https://breachsense.io/blog/data-breach-examples/) is what happened to Apple, where cyberattackers stole phone prototypes from their production lines and found ways of hacking people’s phones.  

Effectively dealing with information theft involves a multi-faceted approach, including physical security measures, robust cybersecurity defenses, [a robust data breach response plan](https://breachsense.io/blog/data-breach-response-plan), and comprehensive employee training on data protection protocols.
### #6. Brute Force Attack 
A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used by cybercriminals to test various passwords until they find the ones that work. 

Through this method, the attacker systematically checks all possible combinations until the correct one is found. This attack type can be time-consuming but can be accelerated with the use of bots or powerful computers. 

[Implementing complex passwords](https://breachsense.io/blog/password-security-data-breach/), enabling account lockouts after a certain number of failed attempts, and utilizing MFA can help deter brute force attacks.
#7. SQL Injection Attack 
SQL Injection is a type of cyberattack in which an attacker inserts malicious SQL code into a query. 

The attacker can use a malicious payload to manipulate the database and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Meanwhile, this type of data breach can lead to data theft, data corruption, or even a loss of control over the database. 

To prevent SQL Injection attacks, organizations should use parameterized queries, employ web application firewalls, and regularly update and patch their database management systems. Regular audits and penetration testing can also help identify and [fix vulnerabilities](https://breachsense.io/blog/vulnerabilities-cause-data-loss/) before they can be exploited.

## Why Do Data Breaches Happen?
So now you know more about the most frequent data breach types. But why do they occur in the first place? 

Some of the most [common data breach causes](https://breachsense.io/blog/data-breach-causes/) are:

* **[Human error](https://breachsense.io/blog/data-breach-human-error/)**: This is among the most common data breach causes and it involves employees falling for phishing scams, misconfigured security settings, or failing to follow established data protection protocols. Even something as simple as leaving a logged-in computer unattended can lead to a data breach. 
* **[Insider misuse](https://beachsense.io/blog/insider-threat-data-breach/)**: An unauthorized employee deliberately accesses the company’s system for personal gain or convenience. This type of data breach is particularly common in [highly regulated industries, like healthcare](https://breachsense.io/blog/impact-of-data-breach-healthcare/). 
* **Stolen devices**: Physical theft of thumb drives, hard drives, laptops, tablets, phones, or any other device containing your company’s sensitive information. 
* **Social engineering**: By using psychological manipulation to trick individuals into breaking normal security procedures or divulging confidential information, cybercriminals gain access to confidential information like passwords and bank information, or gain access to systems or networks for malicious purposes
* **Unpatched security vulnerabilities**: These refer to identified weaknesses or flaws in a system's software or hardware that have not been addressed or fixed through updates or patches, leaving data open to cyber criminals. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access to a system, enabling them to steal sensitive data, disrupt operations, or install malicious software.
* **[Third-party breaches](https://breachsense.io/blog/third-party-data-breach)**: A company's sensitive data is compromised through its relationships with external partners, vendors, or service providers that have access to their systems or data.

## 8 Common Malware Cyber Attackers Use for Data Breaches
Malware is an umbrella term for various types of malicious software, such as: 

* **Trojan**: A Trojan is a program that initially appears beneficial, but upon download, accesses sensitive data and can delete, modify, or obstruct it.
* **Worm**: A worm is a type of software that infects your device via a downloaded file. It rapidly replicates and disseminates to other devices within the same network.
* **Virus**: A virus is a code attached to a file that remains dormant after download until you open the file and start working on it.
* **Adware**: Adware is software that collects data on your computer usage and then shows you ads based on that information. The issue arises when it harbors malware or redirects your browser to harmful sites. Not to mention, excessive adware can considerably slow down your system.
* **Fileless malware**: Diverging from standard malware which operates on a system level, fileless malware works on the computer's memory, making them harder to detect.
* **Infostealer malware**: Infostealer malware is malicious software that primarily focuses on stealing sensitive data from compromised systems, such as login credentials, personal information, and financial details. It typically infiltrates systems via phishing emails, malicious websites, or infected software downloads, and operates discreetly in the background to exfiltrate the targeted data without the user's knowledge.
* **Spyware**: Spyware is a program that, once installed on your computer, enables data transfer from your hardware without your consent. It can expose confidential information such as financial details and passwords.
* **Botnets**: Bots are malicious autonomous programs developed for tasks such as chatting, clicking on links, or spreading spam messages. The goal is to infect a system, steal data, or defraud by, for instance, tricking users into sharing sensitive information.
