## What is dark web monitoring

Dark web monitoring is the process of actively monitoring and tracking various dark web sources, forums, marketplaces, and other online communities for threats, breached data, and other sensitive information. The dark web is the part of the internet that is not indexed by traditional search engines.

The most common use case for dark web monitoring is to help organizations detect if any of their sensitive data or credentials have been compromised and are being sold or traded on the dark web.

Many organizations monitor the dark web to gather intelligence about potential cyber threats, like data leaks, vulnerabilities, exploit code, and new hacking techniques being discussed or traded.

Brand protection is another common use case. Companies monitor any discussions or activities related to their brand, intellectual property, or products that could negatively impact them.

Dark web monitoring typically requires specialized tools for data scraping and natural language processing to automatically scan and analyze the huge amount of data involved. The indexed data is then analyzed and correlated to identify potential threats, data breaches, or other relevant information.

## What causes data breaches

In order to understand how dark web monitoring services work, let's first understand what causes data breaches.

Data breaches happen for various reasons, including:

- **Weak access controls:** Inadequate access controls, such as default, leaked or stolen login credentials, lack of multi-factor authentication, or improper access management (e.g. misconfigured cloud settings, Insecure Direct Object References, etc.), can allow unauthorized individuals to access sensitive data.
- **Hacking and cyber attacks:** Malicious actors can exploit vulnerabilities in software to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. This often involves techniques like Stored Cross Site Scripting and SQL Injection.
- **[Insider threats](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/insider-threat-data-breach/):** Data breaches can also result from insiders, such as disgruntled employees or contractors, who intentionally or unintentionally misuse or steal sensitive data.
- **Physical theft or loss:** Laptops, mobile devices, or storage media containing sensitive data can be lost or stolen, leading to a data breach.
- **[Human error](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/data-breach-human-error/):** Accidental data exposure, misconfigured systems, or improper handling of sensitive data by employees can lead to data breaches.
- **[Third-party vulnerabilities](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/third-party-data-breach/):** If third-party vendors, partners, or service providers that have access to your organization's data suffer a breach, your data can be leaked due to their breach.
- **Lack of encryption:** Failure to encrypt sensitive data at rest or in transit can make it easier for threat actors to access and misuse the data if a breach occurs.
- **Outdated software and systems**: Using outdated software or systems that are missing security updates and patches can make an organization more vulnerable to data breaches.
- **Poor data disposal practices:** Improper disposal or destruction of hardware, documents, or other media containing sensitive data can lead to data breaches if the data falls into the wrong hands.

## Who needs dark web monitoring

Dark web monitoring services are typically needed by organizations with access to sensitive data.

Common use cases include:

1. **Enterprises and organizations:** Large enterprises and organizations, particularly those dealing with sensitive customer data, intellectual property, or financial information, often need to monitor the dark web to detect potential data breaches or threats to their assets.
2. **Financial institutions:** Banks, credit card companies, and other financial institutions need to monitor the dark web for any signs of financial fraud, stolen credentials, or data breaches that could compromise their customers' financial information.
3. **Healthcare organizations:** Healthcare providers, insurance companies, and pharmaceutical companies need to monitor the dark web for potential breaches of patient data, medical records, or proprietary information.
4. **Government agencies:** Government agencies and law enforcement organizations monitor dark web threats to track illegal activities, such as terrorism, human trafficking, and the trade of illicit goods or services.
5. **Retail and e-commerce companies:** Online retailers and e-commerce platforms need to monitor the dark web for potential threats to their customer data, payment information, or intellectual property.
6. **Educational institutions:** Universities and colleges often need to monitor the dark web to protect their research data, student information, and intellectual property from potential breaches or misuse.
7. **Cybersecurity firms:** Cybersecurity companies and threat intelligence providers often offer dark web monitoring services as part of their portfolio to help clients detect and mitigate cyber criminal activity.
8. **Law firms and legal organizations:** Law firms and legal organizations handling sensitive client information or high-profile cases need to monitor the dark web for potential data leaks or threats.

## Key features to look for in a dark web monitoring solution

When evaluating a dark web monitoring solution, there are several key features to consider:

- **Comprehensive coverage:** The solution should have the capability to monitor a wide range of dark web sources, including [ransomware gangs](https://www.breachsense.com/ransomware-gangs/), forums, [marketplaces](https://www.breachsense.com/darknet-markets/), [chat rooms](https://www.breachsense.com/telegram-channels/), and other hidden platforms where sensitive data is leaked or sold.
- **Advanced data collection and analysis**: The solution should use a combination of HumInt and automated techniques like web crawling, data scraping, and natural language processing to efficiently collect and analyze the data.
- **Real-time alerts and notifications:** The solution should provide real-time alerts and notifications when potential threats or data breaches are detected, allowing for quick investigation and response.
- **API Support:** The solution should have a native API integration to enable security teams to automate their dark web monitoring and remediation.
- **Integration capabilities:** The ability to integrate with existing security tools, such as security information and event management (SIEM) systems, incident response platforms, or threat intelligence platforms, can streamline the overall threat management process.
- **Incident Response Tools:** The tool should enable incident response investigators to understand who a threat actor is, other usernames and passwords used by the attacker, as well the ability to pivot on various pieces of information to build a comprehensive picture of an attack.
- **Vendor expertise and support:** It's important to consider the vendor's expertise in dark web monitoring, as well as the level of support and how often their dataset is updated.
