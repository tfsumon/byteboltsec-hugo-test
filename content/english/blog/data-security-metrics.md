## What are data security metrics?

Data security metrics are specific, quantifiable metrics that provide insights into various aspects of an organization's data security posture. These metrics are typically low-level and focused on specific areas, such as the number of data breaches, the percentage of systems with security patches applied, or the time taken to respond to security incidents. Data security metrics are often used to monitor and assess the effectiveness of individual security controls, processes, or activities.

## KPIs in data security

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in cybersecurity are higher-level, strategic indicators that measure the overall performance and effectiveness of an organization's cybersecurity program. KPIs are derived from a combination of relevant data security metrics and other factors, providing a more comprehensive view of the organization's security posture.

KPIs are designed to align with the organization's strategic goals and objectives, enabling stakeholders to track progress toward achieving those goals. They are typically more business-oriented and focused on measuring the impact and outcomes of cybersecurity efforts rather than just individual security controls or processes.

For example, while the "number of data breaches" is a data security metric, a KPI might be the "percentage reduction in data breaches" or the "cost of data breaches as a percentage of revenue," which provides a broader and more strategic perspective.

## Why are data security metrics and KPIs important?

Data security metrics and KPIs play an important role in enabling organizations to measure, monitor, and improve their cybersecurity posture effectively. On one hand, data security metrics provide quantifiable measurements that assess the effectiveness of specific security controls, processes, and activities. These granular metrics help identify vulnerabilities, weaknesses, or areas that require attention and improvement, allowing organizations to prioritize their security efforts and allocate resources more efficiently.

On the other hand, KPIs offer a more strategic view, measuring the overall performance and effectiveness of an organization's cybersecurity program. KPIs are designed to align with the organization's strategic goals and objectives, enabling stakeholders to track progress toward achieving those goals and demonstrating the value of security initiatives and investments. By providing quantifiable and objective information, data security metrics and KPIs facilitate data-driven decisions related to cybersecurity investments, risk management strategies, and resource allocations.

## How to choose the right cybersecurity metrics

There is no universal list of data security metrics that all businesses should track. The specific metrics you choose to monitor will largely depend on your organization's unique needs and risk tolerance. However, it is crucial to select KPIs that are clear and understandable to anyone reviewing your reporting, including non-technical stakeholders.

A good rule of thumb is that if your non-technical colleagues can't understand them, you either need to switch KPIs or do a better job of explaining them. Another tip, benchmarks and industry comparisons are extremely effective ways to make complex metrics more understandable.
