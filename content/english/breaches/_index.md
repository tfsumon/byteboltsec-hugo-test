In 2017, The Economist named data [the world’s most valuable resource](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data), and that, of course, is still true today.  
  
But just as data creates and powers more and more lucrative industries, it also caught the interest of cybercriminals.  
  
Personal and company data - _names, addresses, Social Security numbers, credit card details, login credentials, or other sensitive information_ - can be used for anything from identity theft, financial fraud to many other malicious activities.  
  
As a result, it’s no surprise that data breaches are on the rise, with an ever increasing number of companies of all shapes and sizes facing information theft and data leaks.  
  
**What’s more, these data breaches happen every day with staggering consequences.**

* Over 4100 publicly disclosed data breaches happened last year alone. That’s roughly eleven breaches per day, and that is based only on the publicly disclosed data!
* Nearly 109 million accounts were breached in just the 3rd quarter of 2022.
* Finally, on average, a data breach costs companies $4.6M.

Below, you’ll find a regularly updated list of the most recent data breaches. This data is directly indexed from the threat actors' websites.  
  
We track various [ransomware threat actors](https://www.breachsense.com/ransomware-gangs/), and index the victims as well as where their leaked data is stored.  
  
This enables security teams affected from those breaches (both the victim company and any clients and suppliers of theirs whose data was leaked as part of their breach) can access the data and mitigate the risk based on what was actually leaked.
