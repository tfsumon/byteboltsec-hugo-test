## Protect Your Customers From Data Breaches ##

Botnets are networks of computers infected with malware that enable criminals to steal data at scale. Many users are unwittingly using systems infected with various strains of info-stealer malware. Some common examples are Redline, Meta, or Vidar. The malware provides cybercriminals access to their victim's account passwords and full browser details. The malware steals the credentials and session tokens which are then collected and shared within small criminal circles, private chat groups as well as various underground hacking forums. Having valid usernames and passwords makes it simple for hackers to perpetrate account takeover attacks, blackmail, identity theft, as well as make fraudulent purchases. 

Breachsense recovers this data to provide malware intelligence to organizations in order to protect themselves before criminals leverage the stolen data for online fraud.

### Stealer Logs ###

Today's malware is distributed through a variety of methods, such as email attachments, malicious websites, SEO poisoning of popular software, malvertising, phishing emails, and more. Once infected, the malware monitors its victim's keystrokes and uploads their system data to command & control (C2) servers. The uploaded data includes various records such as:

* credentials
* Hostnames & IP addresses plus the usernames and passwords used to authenticate
* Session tokens
* Autofill data
* Crypto wallets
* System architecture, language, computer, and user names
* List of installed programs

When Breachsense finds your client's credentials or session token for your domain in stealer logs, that means that their account may have been taken over by malicious users.

This means that any sensitive actions taken, such as purchases, may be completely fraudulent. By having ongoing visibility into your employees' and clients' breached credentials, you can reset their accounts before fraud occurs.

### The Breachsense Difference ###
