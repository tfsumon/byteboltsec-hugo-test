  content: >-
    * Breachsense tracks all layers of the darknet continuously, including Tor websites, private IRC and Telegram channels, ransomware threat actors, cybercrime communities and forums, and more.
    <br/>
 
    * The curated data is then enriched with context, hashed passwords are cracked to plaintext and multiple search paths are indexed.
    <br/> 

    * Configure a list of assets you want to be notified about. Assets can be email addresses, domain names, IP addresses or hardware IDs. Notifications are sent via web hook or email.
    <br/> 

    * Query the API endpoints to receive all of the historical data known about a given asset. 
    <br/> 

    * Automate remediation by integrating our API driven platform into your defense framework.
