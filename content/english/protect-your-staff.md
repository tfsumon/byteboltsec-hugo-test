## Protect Your Staff From Data Breaches ##

One of the most common methods hackers use to gain access to your organization is through your employees' breached credentials. Having valid credentials enables criminals to bypass common security controls such as firewalls, WAFs and IDSes. Once the attacker successfully authenticates with stolen or leaked credentials, they can easily access sensitive data that may include financial information, intellectual property (IP), customer records, or other confidential information.

Employee credential theft is one of the most prevalent forms of cybercrime in today's workplace. In fact, a recent survey by the Ponemon Institute found that nearly half of all organizations have experienced an employee-related breach within the last two years. This means that you are vulnerable to attacks from outside sources even when your network is otherwise secure. To make matters worse, criminals often use leaked session tokens (e.g. session cookies) to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA). Continuous monitoring for potential threats allows your security team to:

* prevent cyber attacks due to identity theft
* prevent account takeover attacks that lead to ransomware
* protect your brand and reputation

### How does Dark Web Monitoring Work? ###

Dark web monitoring works by monitoring threat actors on various dark web forums, paste sites, and Telegram channels for leaked company data and employees' credentials. Criminals use these credentials to log into the victim's network, which allows them to view internal files, steal sensitive information, and even launch further attacks against the organization.

The problem is that many companies don't know about this type of activity until after the damage has been done. The good news is that there are solutions available to help you detect potential breaches before they occur. By using dark web monitoring tools, you'll be able to mitigate the risk associated with the leaked data and credentials.

### Why Should You Monitor Dark Web Activity? ###

Monitoring the dark web for signs of malicious activity is critical because it helps you identify potential threats before they're used against your business. If you catch these activities early enough, you can take steps to protect yourself from future attacks. For example, if you identify employee credentials to your organization's services, you can mitigate the risk by requiring secondary authentication before sensitive requests are made. The affected accounts should also have password resets issued before any suspicious activity is detected. 

Dark web monitoring helps prevent criminal activity by providing real time alerts that allow you to act quickly to stop an attack. It also provides insight into how attackers are gaining access to your systems, allowing your IT staff to better understand their tactics and develop countermeasures.

With customizable threat alerts, you can set up rules based on specific criteria, including domain names, IP addresses, as well the personal email address associated with C-level executives (in case they reuse the same password across multiple applications).

### How Breachsense Helps Keep Your Employees Safe ###

Common defensive strategies often include using a password manager as well as requiring MFA to authenticate. However, a stolen browser session from your enterprise’s single sign-on (SSO) provider can enable malicious users to bypass MFA to access corporate resources. Continuous dark web monitoring is necessary to ensure that company assets can not be accessed without proper authorization. 

Breachsense is a dark web monitoring service that provides real-time alerts whenever your company's assets (company data as well as employee and customer credentials) appear in a data leak or breach. Data from criminal forums and dark web marketplaces are continuously imported to enable your security team to prevent credential stuffing attacks.
