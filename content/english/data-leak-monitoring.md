    Monitoring for data leaks is a challenging and expensive task requiring constant data and intelligence collection across multiple platforms. This includes monitoring the dark web, public internet, and other online platforms for signs that sensitive information like employee credentials, session tokens, or internal company documents have been exposed or are being sold or shared without authorization.<br><br>Initial Access Brokers and various threat actors sell and trade access to millions of networks daily. Breachsense uses both human and artificial intelligence to collect and analyze raw intelligence from across the dark web in real time. This enables security teams to locate compromised credentials, session tokens and other potential threats before they can be exploited. By continuously scanning and analyzing these sources, organizations can proactively detect and respond to data leaks, reducing the risk of financial loss, reputational damage, and legal consequences.

  - question: "What is Data Leak Monitoring?"
    answer: "Data leak monitoring is the process of monitoring the dark web (dark web forums and dark web sites) for mentions of specific individuals, brands, phone numbers, other compromised credentials, and other types of sensitive information. With data leaks becoming increasingly common, ongoing data leak monitoring is essential for ensuring the safety of your customers' and employees’ sensitive personal information."

  - question: "How Does Data Leak Monitoring Work?"
    answer: "Breachsense is a data leak monitoring solution that continuously tracks millions of online sources, including IRC and Telegram channels, private cybercrime communities, ransomware marketplaces, and more. Your security team is notified the moment there are any mentions of your:

  * Employee or customer account credentials or other sensitive data <br />

  * Login credentials to your C-level executive accounts <br />

  * Credentials for remote access servers like SSH, Remote Desktop, and FTP<br />

  * Internal company emails or documents<br />

  * Employee corporate or government-issued IDs
"

  - question: "Why is Data Leak Monitoring Important?"
    answer: "Data leak monitoring helps you detect data leaks in your organization in real time, notifying you the moment there’s a mention of any sensitive information related to your organization. While you won’t be able to delete these mentions on the dark web, you will be able to apply preventative measures by canceling accounts, changing passwords, and so on, mitigating any potential damage."
    
  - question: "Is a Data Leak the Same as Data Breach?"
    answer: "It’s true that both terms - \"data leak\" and \"data breach\" - seem as if they referred to the same type of a cyber threat. In reality, however, they do have slightly different meanings. A data leak usually means an unauthorized release of confidential data, whether intentional or unintentional by a third party but also an employee of a company. A data breach, on the other hand, occurs where a third party gains unauthorized access, often malicious, to compromise sensitive information within a system or network."
