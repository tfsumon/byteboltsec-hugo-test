  - question: "What is Data Breach Monitoring?"
    answer: "Data breach monitoring is the process of monitoring data breaches for mentions of specific individuals, brands, phone numbers, and other types of sensitive information. With data breaches becoming increasingly common, ongoing monitoring is essential for ensuring the safety of your customers' and employees’ sensitive personal information."

  - question: "How Does Data Breach Monitoring Work?"
    answer: "Breachsense continuously tracks millions of online sources, including IRC and Telegram channels, private cybercrime communities, ransomware marketplaces, and more. Your security team is notified the moment there are any mentions of your:

* Employee or customer account credentials or other sensitive data <br />

* Login credentials to your C-level executive accounts <br />

* Credentials for remote access servers like SSH, Remote Desktop, and FTP<br />

* Internal company emails or documents<br />

* Employee corporate or government-issued IDs
"

  - question: "How Data Breach Monitoring Helps Prevent Cybercrime?"
    answer: "By detecting data breaches in real time, your security team will be able to react immediately before any damage is done. The moment a breach is detected, you can:

* Disable Compromised Accounts<br />

* Prevent Fraudulent Purchases</br>

* Upgrade Your Security Measures"
 
  - question: "Is A Data Breach The same As A Data Leak?"
    answer: "It’s true that both terms - \"data breach\" and \"data leak\" - seem as if they referred to the same type of a cyber threat. In reality, however, they do have slightly different meanings. A data breach occurs where a third party gains unauthorized access, often malicious, to compromise sensitive information within a system or network. A data leak, on the other hand, usually means an unauthorized release of confidential data, whether intentional or unintentional by a third party but also an employee of a company."
