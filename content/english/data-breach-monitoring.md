    answer: "Data breach monitoring helps you detect data breaches in your organization in real time, notifying you the moment there’s a mention of any sensitive information related to your organization. While you won’t be able to delete these mentions on the dark web, you will be able to apply preventative measures by canceling accounts, changing passwords, and so on, mitigating any potential damage."

  - question: "Is data breach monitoring worth it?"
    answer: "Data breach monitoring is definitely worth it. Data breaches can be very costly for organizations, both in terms of monetary losses and customer trust. The average cost of a data breach can be up to $4.62 million, while up to 65% of your customers are likely to lose trust in your organization because of a breach. As such, data breach monitoring is essential for protecting your organization, staff, and customers."

    answer: "The moment you detect sensitive information in a data breach, it’s time to act. Start by finding the exposed account credentials and changing passwords. Find the source of the leak, and patch it. Require 2-Factor Authentication to access all company applications to prevent unauthorized access. Train your staff on proper cybersecurity hygiene."
