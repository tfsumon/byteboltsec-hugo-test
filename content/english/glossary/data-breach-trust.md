## Data Breaches Damage Brand Reputation
[Data breaches](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/what-is-a-data-breach/) can severely undermine the trust customers place in an organization's ability to safeguard their personal information. As revealed by a Centrify study, 65% of data breach victims reported a loss of trust in an organization following a breach, which can have enduring consequences on customer loyalty and retention.

According to Forbes, [80% of consumers in developed countries will abandon a business](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/12/08/mind-the-trust-gap-how-companies-can-retain-customers-after-a-security-breach/#40b4b2806c95) if their personally identifiable information is compromised in a security breach. 

Additionally, IDC projected that by 2019, 70% of major multinational corporations with origins in the United States and Europe would face significant cybersecurity attacks targeting the disruption of commodity distribution. 

Such attacks not only present a [direct risk to a company's operations](https://www.breachsense.com/blog/after-a-breach/) but can also erode customer confidence in the brand.

The financial implications of losing customer trust reach beyond immediate revenue losses, impacting long-term profitability as organizations grapple with rebuilding their reputation.
