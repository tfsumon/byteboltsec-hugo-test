  content: >-
    * Breachsense tracks all layers of the darknet continuously, including Tor websites, private IRC and Telegram channels, ransomware threat actors, cybercrime communities and forums, and more.
    <br/>
 
    * The curated data is then enriched with context, hashed passwords are cracked to plaintext and multiple search paths are indexed.
    <br/> 

    * For managed services, configure a list of assets to be notified about. Assets can be email addresses, domain names, IP addresses or hardware IDs. Notifications are sent via web hook or email.
    <br/> 

    * For pre-sales, query the API endpoints to receive all of the historical data known about a given asset. 
    <br/> 

    * Verify the actual risk by testing plaintext credentials then forcing a password reset in Active Directory.
